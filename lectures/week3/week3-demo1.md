# pwd 

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory

When you're just starting out, it could be helpful to `pwd` everwhere you `cd` to just to visualize the directory structure. 

```
pwd     # prints the current working directory
```

# ls

```
ls .    # current directory
ls      # default argument is .
ls ..   # parent directory
ls -l file1 file2 file 3    # show tab completion
ls -l 
ls -latrh
```

# cd 
```
cd /    # root
cd ~    # home
cd .    # does nothing b/c cwd
cd ..   # parent
cd      # home b/c default arg is ~
```
# show clear and history
```
clear # clears terminal output
history # all of your commands
history 5 # last 5
```

# show help page
```
info ls # q to quit
man ls
```
