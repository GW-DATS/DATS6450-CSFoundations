# Final Project

### DATS 6450 - Foundations of Computer Science (Spring 2018)
### Instructors - Mike Arango & Brent Skoumal
### Due: 12/12/18 @ 11:59 pm

## How to submit

The link to your team's GitHub repository for the final project should be submitted to Blackboard. Only 1 team member should submit the link to Blackboard, but a list of all team members should be included with the link in the submission. 

## Project Guidelines

The goal of the final project is to apply what you have learned in this course to a real world problem that you will most likely encounter working in industry as a data scientist. Throughout the semester, we have learned about: 
- computer systems
- the command line
- git/GitHub 
- structuring data science projects
- reporting with markdown
- packaging your Python code

You will work in groups of 3 to create a Python package from scratch to solve some data science problem. This package should be publicly available on GitHub as a repository and your project team should use git for version control. The repository should be well-docummented and each phase of the project should follow the best practices discussed in class. For example, commit messages should be short and informative like "add installation instructions to README.md" as opposed to "updated README file with all the important stuff and then created a new preprocessing script with 3 functions to parse and clean text." Further, each new feature added to your package should be developed in a separate branch, not the master branch. You must send Mike and Brent your project team members in the `#project-groups` Slack channel by 11/16/18. 

### Minimum Criteria of the GitHub Repository
Your repository should, at a minimum, have each of the following files: 
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `AUTHORS.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `setup.py`
- a folder titled with the name of your package and all accompanying code
    - This folder should include a `__init__.py` script

### Minimum Git Criteria
Each team member should, at a minimum, meet the following criteria for adding changes to the repository: 
- At least 1 issue must be assigned to and resolved by *each* team member
- At least 1 branch must be created and merged (by submitting a pull request) by *each* team member
- *Each* team member must have at least 5 non-trivial commits (An example of a trivial commit would be adding the README file)

### Code Guidelines

There is no minimum criteria for the number of lines of code or number of functions as these are pretty arbitrary and depend on the problem being solved. However, we advise students to use their discretion on how much code at a minimum is feasible to write in a month (the time given to complete the project). Moreover, we are requiring that there be *at least* 3 (not including `__init__.py`).
